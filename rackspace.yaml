  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to MongoDB, check out the [Getting Started with
  MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) guide.
  This document covers the basics of connecting to and using your new replica
  set.

  #### Serious About MongoDB?
  Built from the ground up, ObjectRocket is the premium MongoDB
  database-as-a-service (DBaaS). It is the only solution that's highly
  available, automatically sharded, and unbelievably fast by default.
  Start your free trial at [ObjectRocket.com](http://objectrocket.com).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  MongoDB has been installed via package. The configuration file for Mongo is
  /etc/mongod.conf. All data is stored in /var/lib/mongodb.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
